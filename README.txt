Just some notes for future implementation

1. A cell dies when it has zero energy
2. A cell dies when it has too much temperature
3. When a cell dies, its body (sugar) slowly is absorved by the media and it will slowly lose youngs modulus
4. A cell can absorve sugar from media and can also absorve energy from radiation
5. A new born cell will slowly build up youngs modulus
6. The Contact dissipated energy is translated in cell damage which is inverselly proportional to its stiffness
7. A cell consumes energy to keep its temperature and healing and also for reproduction
8. Sugar transfer can be diffused accross cell, and it is proportional to the cell wall difusifity
8. Heat transfer can happen between contacting cells, proportional to the cell material properties
